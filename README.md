# Working
As customer sits on the restaurent table the speech API sends greetings message. Now the Augmented Reality(AR) part takes place. The customer selects the suitable language and the whole menu is on the table. The camera module detects the finger and place the order in the admin table. Once the order is confirmed, total amount is displayed and the customer can pay with debit card. The card is detected with the help of vision API. And the process is completed.
